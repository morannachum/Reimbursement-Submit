Reimbursement-Submit
====================

A small, insignificant project in which I can mess around with HTML.  The goal is to create a web form through which users will be able to enter information related to reimbursement.  This will include personal information about the user, such as a name, address, etc. and a means by which to upload picture files (which will be used to verify the data inputted by the user).


Thank you,
